These icons were originally made for Mosaic for X and have been
included in the NCSA httpd and Apache server distributions in the
past. They are in the public domain and may be freely included in any
application. The originals were done by Kevin Hughes (kevinh@kevcom.com).
Andy Polyakov tuned the icon colors and added a few new images.

If you'd like to contribute additions to this set, contact the httpd
documentation project <http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/>.

Almost all of these icons are 20x22 pixels in size.  There are
alternative icons in the "small" directory that are 16x16 in size,
provided by Mike Brown (mike@hyperreal.org).
